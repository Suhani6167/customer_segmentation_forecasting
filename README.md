# Customer Segmentation & Forecasting

## Overview
This project performs **Customer Segmentation** using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and forecasts future sales. It identifies high-value customers, highlights at-risk segments, and provides actionable insights via interactive dashboards.

## Dataset
- `cleaned_retail_data.csv` — Cleaned transactional data  
- `predictive_dataset.csv` — Data for forecasting  
- `rfm_scores.csv` — Calculated RFM scores  

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** — Handle missing values, duplicates, and calculate total sales.  
2. **RFM Analysis** — Compute Recency, Frequency, Monetary and assign scores; classify customers into segments.  
3. **Dashboard (Power BI)** — Visualize KPIs, customer segments, and revenue contribution.  
4. **Forecasting** — Predict future revenue using historical sales data.  
5. **Python Scripts** — Modular scripts for cleaning, analysis, and RFM calculation.
